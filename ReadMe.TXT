Running the program in CMD after compiling it with javac will fail to get the path to the images in the docs directory. 
I created a class path for the docs directory in the batch file provided  to solve this issue.

To run the program, launch the batch file and use the following addresses:

localhost:1234/docs/cat.jpg

localhost:1234/docs/sky.jpg
